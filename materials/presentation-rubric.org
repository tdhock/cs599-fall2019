- 10 points, signed up by Weds Sep 4, 11:59pm.
- 10 points, clarity of oral presentation.
- 10 points, repeating questions from the audience, and clarity/correctness of responses.
  - 1-3 points for not repeating the questions.
  - 4-5 points for repeated questions but incorrect responses.
  - 6-7 points for repeated questions and "I dont know" responses.

  - 6-10 points for mentioning all of above.
- 10 points, new contributions relative to previous work.
- 10 points, overall strengths and weaknesses of the paper (at least
  one of each).
  - Theoretical results / proofs
  - Empirical results / real data / convincing figures (with error bands)
  - Good/clear English
  - Easy to understand math / everything well defined
  - Novel idea
  - Very clear about what is new relative to previous work
  - 1-5 points for not mentioning points above.
  - 6-10 points for mentioning points above.
- 10 points, ideas for future work.
  - 1-5 points for a vague discussion.
  - 6-10 points for mentioning concrete ideas for future papers.
- 10 points, oral explanation of of axes, legends, main message.
- 10 points, strengths / weaknesses / room for improvement.
  - 1-5 points for not mentioning any of the points below.
  - 6-10 points if mention at least one of the points below for each of the strengths/weaknesses.
- 10 points, which figures are (not) suitable for the coding
  projects of this class? Why? Coding projects should be
  non-trivial, typically result figures.

Good figures have:
- Text size which is easy to read, about the same size as main text
  (not too much bigger or smaller).
- Legends or (better) direct labels to explain colors/linetypes/etc.
- Error bands/bars to show significant differences between items
  (e.g. algorithms).
- Axes with ticks/labels in interpretable units (e.g. time series data
  measured at 30Hz, axes ticks are in units of seconds rather than
  observation number).
- Aligned axes for related plots with identical units.
- Caption which allows interpretation of the figure without having
  to read the main text.

Bad figures have:
- Data variables which are encoded using more than one visual property
  (e.g. drawing each algorithm using a different color and linetype,
  whereas simply using a different color would suffice).
- Colors which are indistinguishable to color-blind readers
  (e.g. red/green).
- Un-used space.
